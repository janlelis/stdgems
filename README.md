## About the Gemified Standard Library

Ruby's standard library is in the process of being gemified. It will soon - **Ruby 2.5** - consist of [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org), which can be updated independently from Ruby. Some standard libraries have already been turned into gems before Ruby 2.5.

There are two different kinds of standard gems:

- **Default gems:** These gems are part of Ruby and you can always require them directly. You cannot remove them. They are maintained by Ruby core.

- **Bundled gems:** The behavior of bundled gems is similar to normal gems, but they get automatically installed when you install Ruby. They can be uninstalled and they are maintained outside of Ruby core.

## About the stdgems project

This repository contains two JSON files:

- [default_gems.json](/default_gems.json)
- [bundled_gems.json](/bundled_gems.json)

They contain data about all default and bundled gems and which versions come with which Ruby version.

On [stdgems.org](https://stdgems.org), the data is used for a readable documentation website.
