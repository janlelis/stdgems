## About the Gemified Standard Library

Ruby's standard library is in the process of being gemified. More and more libraries will be turned into [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org), which can be updated independently from Ruby.

There are two different kinds of standard gems:

- **Default gems:** These gems are part of Ruby and you can always require them directly. You cannot remove them. They are maintained by Ruby core.

- **Bundled gems:** The behavior of bundled gems is similar to normal gems, but they get automatically installed when you install Ruby. They can be uninstalled and they are maintained outside of Ruby core.

Checkout [Hiroshi Shibata's talk at RubyConf 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93nGROEgyEc) for more info. Also see [Ruby issue #5481](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/5481) for the current state of the gemification project.

## Standard Gems Version Data

Every Ruby version ships a specific set of default and bundled gems. The tables below list included gems of the current Ruby version **<%= current_ruby_version %>**. There is also [version comparison](/compare) that shows which Ruby version comes with which gem versions. The raw data is available as [default_gems.json](/default_gems.json) and [bundled_gems.json](/bundled_gems.json).

## Default Gems (Ruby <%= current_ruby_version %>)

Gem | Version | Description | Resources
----|---------|-------------|----------
<%= default_gems_list %>
{:.table-20-10-45-X}

## Bundled Gems (Ruby <%= current_ruby_version %>)

Gem | Version | Description | Resources
----|---------|-------------|----------
<%= bundled_gems_list %>
{:.table-20-10-45-X}

## Gems per Ruby Version

<%= listed_ruby_versions.group_by{ |ruby_version| ruby_version.to_f }.map{ |_, ruby_versions| "- Gem list for Ruby: " + ruby_versions.map{ |ruby_version| "[#{ruby_version}](/#{ruby_version})" }.join(" - ") }.join("\n") %>

## Non-Gemified Standard Libraries

A list of standard libraries which have not yet turned into gems can be found at [libraries](/libraries). The respective JSON file is at [libraries.json](/libraries.json).
