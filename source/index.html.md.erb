## About the Gemified Standard Library

Ruby's standard library is in the process of being gemified. It will soon - **Ruby 2.5** - consist of [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org), which can be updated independently from Ruby. Some standard libraries have already be turned into gems before Ruby 2.5.

There are two different kinds of standard gems:

- **Default gems:** These gems are part of Ruby and you can always require them directly. You cannot remove them. They are maintained by Ruby core.

- **Bundled gems:** The behavior of bundled gems is similar normal gems, but they get automatically installed when you install Ruby. They can be uninstalled and they are maintained outside of Ruby core.

## Standard Gems Version Data

Every Ruby version ships a specific set of default and bundled gems. The tables below list included gems of the current Ruby version **<%= current_ruby_version %>**. There is also [version matrix](/matrix), a table which describes which Ruby version comes with which gem versions. The raw data is available as [default_gems.json](/default_gems.json) and [bundled_gems.json](/bundled_gems.json).

## Default Gems (Ruby <%= current_ruby_version %>)

Gem | Version | Description | Resources
----|---------|-------------|----------
<%= default_gems_list %>
{:.table-20-10-45-X}

## Bundled Gems (Ruby <%= current_ruby_version %>)

Gem | Version | Description | Resources
----|---------|-------------|----------
<%= bundled_gems_list %>
{:.table-20-10-45-X}

## Gems per Ruby Version

<%= listed_ruby_versions.group_by{ |ruby_version| ruby_version.to_f }.map{ |_, ruby_versions| "- Gem list for Ruby: " + ruby_versions.map{ |ruby_version| "[#{ruby_version}](/#{ruby_version})" }.join(" - ") }.join("\n") %>
